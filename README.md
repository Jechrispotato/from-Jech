Website Design Report: From Jech
The From Jech website was designed to reflect the unique identity of the brand—a thrift shop that merges timeless fashion with sustainable values. The design decisions were driven by the goal of creating a visually engaging, user-friendly platform that communicates the brand’s core message while appealing to its style-conscious audience. For it design Decisions, I chose a minimalist, editorial-inspired layout to allow the clothing and messaging to speak for themselves. The color palette features soft neutrals and muted earth tones to evoke warmth, sophistication, and a sense of sustainability such us off white, pink and greyish-black. These choices help position From Jech as a boutique brand rather than a typical thrift store, promoting sustainability in every fabric waste. Typography played a key role in establishing the brand voice. A sans serif typeface was used for headings to create a sense of tradition and boldness, while a some thin san serif fonts was selected for body text to maintain readability and a modern look. Ample white space throughout the site was intentional, giving content room to breathe and allowing users to focus on the story and the pieces themselves. The layout was kept intuitive with clear sections: "Home", "Products", “About”and "Contacts" serve to ground users in the brand's values and service, while visual elements like imagery and hover effects enhance user engagement without overwhelming the experience. For the target audience, the website is aimed at style-conscious individuals aged 18–35 who value self-expression, creativity, and sustainability; more of gen-z type of audiences. This demographic is often drawn to vintage and thrift fashion for its uniqueness and environmental benefits, that showing a big interest fashion culture. Many in this audience are active on social media and appreciate strong branding, storytelling, and design. They are likely to respond well to From Jech’s blend of classic aesthetics and modern sensibilities, along with the emphasis on individuality and ethical fashion.  For the challenges I encountered, one of the primary challenges during development was balancing aesthetics with usability. Ensuring the website looked polished while remaining easy to navigate required careful planning of layout and responsive design. Styling elements across devices—especially for mobile—posed some difficulties, such as making text legible on smaller screens and keeping imagery scaled appropriately and accessible for all. Another technical challenge was implementing hover effects and interactive elements purely through CSS while keeping the code clean and efficient. There was also a focus on keeping load times low, so image optimization was necessary without compromising visual quality. I did used some JavaScript, but solely for design and visual elements only-not on functions and behavior. Overall, the process required aligning visual design, brand identity, and technical performance to create a cohesive user experience. The end result is a stylish, purposeful website that resonates with its target audience and reflects the vision of From Jech as a new wave in sustainable fashion.
